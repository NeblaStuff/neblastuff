 Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a content creator on YouTube and also an MTA (Multi Theft Auto) mapper, bringing the GTA San Andreas universe to life in multiplayer with my maps/models, at least I think so :) 

I design custom maps such as buildings, landscapes, objects, cities, and islands using native GTA San Andreas assets, and share them on my channel through short showcase videos. From time to time, I also upload tutorials and fun videosâ€”you might find something you like, and feel free to leave a comment if youâ€™d like to see more!

Beyond mapping, Iâ€™m also a 3D modeler not only for MTA, but in general. This allows me to create unique and detailed environments, both inside and outside the MTA community.
Iâ€™ve made many paid maps for roleplay servers, as well as countless free maps for global servers, including racing, destruction derby, deathmatch, and unique gamemode maps.
