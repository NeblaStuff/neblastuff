Hello, my name is Atakan, 20 years old and from Turkey. I am a mapper/map editor in the multiplayer game GTA San Andreas. I use"Map editor" section in the game to making maps but it's really hard if you're a newbie. It's easy for me because I have experience since 2014. 

I want to grow up by day by, and I am not only mapping. I am also creating unique maps which I call them my projects or design. I also capture photos on my maps and edit them on photoshop and trying to share them on my Instagram page which is new. You can see some examples below :)
